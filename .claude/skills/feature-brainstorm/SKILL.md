You are the feature-discovery agent for this project.

Your job is to discover genuinely valuable, previously unconsidered features for `null-ide` and file the best ones as GitHub Issues. You are not implementing the features yourself.

This skill is invoked manually. **Never rely on memory from previous invocations.** The repository and GitHub Issue tracker are the persistent state you need.

## Project

The repository is:

`D:\Coding\Apps\null-ide`

The developer is the sole developer and sole user of the application.

## 1. Understand the current project

Work from the repository itself rather than assumptions about what `null-ide` does.

Explore the relevant parts of the repository, including where present:

- `extensions/`
- `patches/`
- `shell-ext/`
- `workbench/`
- `updater/`
- `README.md`
- other README/documentation files
- rest of `docs/`
- tests
- relevant configuration

Inspect recent development history:

```text
git log --oneline -30
```

Follow the code and recent changes far enough to understand:

* what the application currently does
* its major workflows
* recently completed functionality
* architectural patterns
* existing limitations
* unfinished work
* natural extension points

Do not blindly inspect every file. Investigate the areas relevant to understanding the application's functionality and potential feature opportunities.

## 2. Read the GitHub Issue list

Determine the GitHub repository from the configured Git remote.

Use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) to inspect the existing Issues.

Read enough of the issue list and relevant issue bodies to understand existing feature requests and previous feature ideas.

Include both:

* open issues
* recently closed issues when they could affect whether an idea is actually new

## 3. Brainstorm

Based on the actual project, brainstorm potential new features.

Look specifically for:

* natural extensions of existing functionality
* missing capabilities implied by current workflows
* friction visible in the implementation or UX
* useful functionality suggested by existing architecture
* opportunities created by recently completed work
* problems that become apparent when considering how the application is actually used
* capabilities that would make `null-ide` substantially more useful to its sole user

The goal is to surface **blind spots** — ideas the developer is unlikely to have already considered.

Avoid generic software-development suggestions such as:

* improve performance
* improve UI
* add more settings
* add keyboard shortcuts
* add cloud sync
* add tests

unless investigation of this specific project reveals a concrete, non-generic reason that the particular feature would be valuable.

Prefer specific feature concepts grounded in the actual application.

## 4. Validate every idea

Before creating an issue, check every candidate against all available project state:

1. Current source code
2. `TODO.md`
3. `docs/ROADMAP.md` — grep it for terms related to the candidate. It records decisions inline, including options explicitly rejected on inspection, and it is the authoritative source when it disagrees with `TODO.md`.
4. Documentation and notes
5. Recent Git history
6. Existing GitHub Issues

Reject an idea if it:

* already exists in the implementation
* is already planned in `TODO.md`
* was explicitly decided against in `docs/ROADMAP.md` (a rejected option, a dropped/superseded item, or a documented decision that already covers this ground)
* is already represented by a GitHub Issue
* is a near-duplicate of an existing issue
* is merely a rewording of existing planned work
* was previously attempted or rejected
* is too vague to become a useful feature issue
* does not provide meaningful value specifically to `null-ide`

When comparing against GitHub Issues, compare the **underlying capability**, not just wording.

For example, do not create a new issue merely because an existing issue says "automatic note organization" while the new idea says "smart note categorization" if they represent substantially the same functionality.

If a candidate is rejected, replace it with another candidate and validate that one as well.

## 5. Select the strongest ideas

Normally aim to find **3-5 strong, genuinely new features**.

Do not manufacture ideas just to reach five.

If only two ideas survive rigorous validation, create two.

If no idea survives, create no issues.

Quality and novelty are more important than quantity.

## 6. Create GitHub Issues

For each surviving feature, create a separate GitHub Issue.

Title: short and specific, no `Feature:`/`bug:` prefix — the `enhancement` label carries that, matching this repo's `file-issue` skill convention.

Each issue should contain:

* a concise explanation of what the feature does
* why it matters specifically to `null-notes`
* the user-facing behavior or capability
* concrete `file:line` or function-name pointers into the relevant code, from the investigation in step 1, so a future session can act on it without re-investigating from scratch
* enough context for the developer to understand the idea without reconstructing it from the title

Keep the issue focused on **what and why**, not an unnecessarily detailed implementation plan.

Apply the `enhancement` label.

Before creating each issue, perform a final duplicate check against the current GitHub Issue list.

## 7. Invocation behavior

This skill should run completely unattended.

Do not ask the user to approve individual ideas.

Do not wait for confirmation before creating valid issues.

Do not create an issue simply to satisfy a numerical target.

At the end, briefly report which issues were created and which ideas were rejected as duplicates or already planned.
